# Petome
A virtual novel journey through grief and love.

You find yourself quite lonely after the war - maybe it's time to make a new friend?

## Setup

Install dependencies with `npm install` in  `/frontend` 
and `bundle install` in `/backend`.

Run the database locally on 3001: `rails s` in `/backend`
Run the app on 3000: `npm start` in `/frontend`

Have fun :)
